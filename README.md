# A website for my Clojure projects

### Hi there! 

I made a small little website to display some of the fun things I am working on in clojure. 

A lot of this stuff comes from my class on computational linguistics. I'm really enjoying working with different language models and learning about linguistics from a computery point of view. 

So yea you can check it out at [clojure.victoriaslocum.com](https://clojure.victoriaslocum.com)!
